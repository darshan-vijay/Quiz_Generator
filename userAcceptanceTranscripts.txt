User Acceptance Tests


Bryan Bailey
It took Bryan 5 minutes and 46 seconds to create a quiz.

Notable interactions and comments:
- Bryan was very curious and confused about the API Key field
- Bryan was unable to figure out the API Key field
- Bryan took a long time to set and create the number of questions, though he was not confused
- Bryan needed to be told how to import the quiz to google forms
- Byran commented on the unintuitive nature of the UI. He said it seemed like it was designed for developers, not any other person who would use the app
- Bryan commented that the fact the UI was designed for developers was not an issue, and was only a problem since he was not a developer


Tanya Bailey
It took Tanya 3 minutes and 2 seconds to create a quiz.

Notable interactions and comments:
- When Tanya was unable to do something, she would ask for help instead of attempting to learn the UI. She refused to proceed unless assistance was given
- Tanya did not find the sign in with google button. She needed to be told
- Tanya did not find the menu to open the form parameters. She needed to be told
- Tanya did not find the API key field. She needed to be told and had it entered for her
- Tanya was able to enter the other quiz parameters
- Tanya needed to be told how to import the quiz to google forms


Patrick Bailey
It took Patrick 17 minutes and 20 seconds to create a quiz.

Notable interaction and comments:
- Patrick is a developer with extensive technical knowledge.
- Patrick immediately found the input for the API key. He then spent quite a while trying to find his API key before going through the entire process of creating a new account
- Patrick was able to quickly enter all other fields, except the sign-in with google, which he needed to be told
- Patrick also needed to be told how to find the quiz in the recent quizzes


Things to change in future work:
- Auth should be done through google to prevent users from needing to find the "sign in with google" button
- The LLM API key should be provided by Quizy
- The recent quizzes should be replaced by a loading screen then move to a new page
- The settings should not be in a dropdown

With these changes, the Quizy UI would be much more acceptable for users.
